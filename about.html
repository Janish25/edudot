<h3>Program Outcomes as defined by NBA (PO)
   Engineering Graduates will be able to:<br>
   1. Engineering knowledge:
    Apply the knowledge of mathematics, science, engineering
   fundamentals, and an engineering specialization to the solution of complex engineering
   problems.<br>
   2. Problem analysis: 
   Identify, formulate, review research literature, and analyze complex
   engineering problems reaching substantiated conclusions using first principles of mathematics,
   natural sciences, and engineering sciences.<br>
   3. Design/development of solutions: Design solutions for complex engineering problems and
   design system components or processes that meet the specified needs with appropriate
   consideration for the public health and safety, and the cultural, societal, and environmental
   considerations.<br>
   4. Conduct investigations of complex problems:
    Use research-based knowledge and research
   methods including design of experiments, analysis and interpretation of data, and synthesis of the
   information to provide valid conclusions.<br>
   5. Modern tool usage:
    Create, select, and apply appropriate techniques, resources, and modern
   engineering and IT tools including prediction and modeling to complex engineering activities
   with an understanding of the limitations.<br>
   6. The engineer and society: 
   Apply reasoning informed by the contextual knowledge to assess
   societal, health, safety, legal and cultural issues and the consequent responsibilities relevant to
   the professional engineering practice.<br>
   7. Environment and sustainability:
    Understand the impact of the professional engineering
   solutions in societal and environmental contexts, and demonstrate the knowledge of, and need
   for sustainable development.
   8. Ethics:
    Apply ethical principles and commit to professional ethics and responsibilities and
   norms of the engineering practice.<br>
   9. Individual and team work: 
   Function effectively as an individual, and as a member or leader
   in diverse teams, and in multidisciplinary settings.<br>
   10. Communication:
    Communicate effectively on complex engineering activities with the
   engineering community and with society at large, such as, being able to comprehend and write
   effective reports and design documentation, make effective presentations, and give and receive
   clear instructions.<br>
   11. Project management and finance:
    Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the
   engineering and management principles and apply these to oneâ€™s own work, as a member and
   leader in a team, to manage projects and in multidisciplinary environments.<br>
   12. Life-long learning:
    Recognize the need for, and have the preparation and ability to engage in
   independent and life-long learning in the broadest context of technological change.
   Program Specific Outcomes (PSO)
   At the end of the program, the student
   PSO 1: should be able to understand the concepts of Electronics & Communication engineering
   and their applications in the field of semiconductor technology, consumer electronics, embedded
   system, communication/ networking and other relevant areas.
   PSO 2: Should have an ability to apply technical knowledge and usage of modern hardware &
   software tools related to Electronics & Communication engineering for solving real world
   problems.
   PSO 3: Should have the capability to analyze, comprehend, design & develop electronic
   subsystems/ systems for a variety of engineering applications and thus demonstrating
   professional ethics & concern for societal well being.
   Program Educational Objectives (PEO):
   PEO-1: To produce graduates having a strong background of basic science, Mathematics &
   Engineering and ability to use these tools.
   PEO-2: To produce graduates who can demonstrate technical competence in the field of
   electronics and communication engineering and develop solutions to the complex problems.
   PEO-3: To produce graduates having professional competence through life-long learning such
   as advanced degrees, professional skills and other professional activities related globally to
   engineering & society.
   PEO- 4: To produce graduates who function effectively in a multi-disciplinary environment and
   individually, within a societal and environmental context.
   PEO-5: To produce graduates who would be able to take individual responsibility and work as a
   part of a team towards the fulfillment of both individual and organizational goals.</h3>
